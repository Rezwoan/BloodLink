## 📖 About The Project

> [cite_start]The **BloodLink** project addresses the critical inefficiencies within the blood donation ecosystem[cite: 494]. [cite_start]The current process is often fragmented and manual, leading to dangerous delays for patients, frustration for donors, and preventable wastage of blood units for banks[cite: 495, 496]. [cite_start]This project introduces a centralized, real-time communication platform that connects all key stakeholders[cite: 497]. [cite_start]Our goal is to create a smarter, more interconnected system that boosts donor engagement, minimizes blood wastage, and enhances emergency response capabilities[cite: 502].

### ✨ Key Features

-   [cite_start]**User & Profile Management:** Secure registration, login, and profile updates for all user roles[cite: 9].
-   [cite_start]**Appointment Scheduling:** Donors can easily find donation centers and book appointments[cite: 10].
-   [cite_start]**Real-Time Inventory:** Live tracking of blood stock for hospitals and blood banks[cite: 18].
-   [cite_start]**Urgent Request System:** Hospitals can place and track urgent blood requests from submission to delivery[cite: 19, 20].
-   [cite_start]**Campaign Management:** Tools for organizers to plan, manage, and promote blood drives[cite: 26].
